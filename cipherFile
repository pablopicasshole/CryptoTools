Students studied five World War 1 poems,
analysing themes, language and imagery and
offering their personal response to the poems
studied, both orally and in writing. Students
were then given the task of creating a piece
of writing in letter, diary entry or short story
form, inspired by the war poetry studied and
containing the appropriate features of their
chosen genre. Students had been explicitly
taught the layout and features of letters, diary
entries and short stories and had written in
these genres previously.
